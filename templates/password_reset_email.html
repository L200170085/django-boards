<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Someone asked for a password reset for the email address</p>{{ email }}
<p>Follow the link below:</p>
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}
<p>In case you forgot your Django Boards username: </p>{{ user.username }}
<p>If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser window instead.</p>
<p>If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>The Django Boards Team</p>
